# gtfs-connect
Get Connectivity Insights from GTFS, answering questions that would have required a ton of manual work combing through schedules.

Answer questions like:
- how many trips did the transit network have?
- how many bus trips served a stop between 10:00 and 14:00 on weekdays?
- how many bus trips connect to a train arrival at a station?

GTFS-Connect was developed internally at Metrolinx for use in scoring the local-transit connectivity of each GO station.
It continues to be used internally and has also been used by transit researchers at the University of Waterloo.

GTFS-Connect is under active development and has a lot of hardcoded functionality. If you're interested in using or expanding GTFS-Connect at your transit agency or for your research send me an email and I'll help you get started: eddyionescu@gmail.com
I'm also available for consulting for larger projects, learn more about my background at [http://eddyionescu.com](http://eddyionescu.com).
