# gtfs-connect
Get Connectivity Insights from GTFS, answering questions that would have required a ton of manual work combing through schedules. 

See output/transit_connections.xlsx to see how the output looks like.

Quickly answer questions like:
- how many trips did the transit network have?
- how many bus trips served a stop between 10:00 and 14:00 on weekdays?
- how many bus trips connect to a train arrival at a station?
- how many bus trips or routes are within 400 metres of a station?

GTFS-Connect was developed internally at Metrolinx for use in scoring the local-transit connectivity of each GO station.
It continues to be used internally and has also been used by transit researchers at the University of Waterloo.

GTFS-Connect is under active development but has not been generalized or tested on other agencies. If you're interested in using, modifying, or building on GTFS-Connect at your transit agency or for your research send me an email and I'll be happy to help you get started: eddyionescu@gmail.com

I'm also available for consulting for larger projects, you can learn more about my background at [http://eddyionescu.com](http://eddyionescu.com).
